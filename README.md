# helos

A birth place for organically growing utility software.  I do
not apply my usual standards here.  It can get arbitrarily chaotic!
I might also dump code here which I created for use in different projects
which is not yet mature enough for its own library.
ἕλος (hélos) is Ancient Greek and means "swamp" -- you get the idea.

# Licensing

As a general rule, the software in this repository is available for

v3.  See the LICENSE file for the full Text of the GPL v3.

**However, I, Daniel Jentsch, as the author, explicitly reserve the
right to relicense any future or current version of any part of this
repository under a different license, including proprietary licenses,
as long as I am its only author.**

This means I may choose to stop publishing new
versions under the GPL or any other free license in the future.

Any specific version of the software that has already been released
under the GPL, as long as this policy remains in place, can still be

Of course, when you fork this repo, you cannot inherit this privilege,
since you are not the sole author of its content.  So please adapt the
above text accordingly.

I choose this policy to have the freedom to add software quickly
without legally or morally committing to publishing all its future
versions under any specific terms.
